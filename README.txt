			Heading
----------------------------------------------------------------

This project is made by Atiyah B. Ellerbee. All code is rudimentary, and probably doesn't display all the best coding that I could probably get done. It was fun, and it's done!

			File Stucture
----------------------------------------------------------------

Here be the file stucture. Data folder contains all CSV files, they should generate there automatically. All the mentions of tabulate / tablify should be removed, as I did not use that module. If you still see references in this file, it shouldn't be relevant. Thank you.

Naming conventions: camelCase. 
shorthand is as follows: admin, stud [student(s)], inst [instructor(s)], cour [course(s)], {nil}Class [child class file], {nil}Exe [executable file], {nil}Util [utility file].

--→ THE MAIN EXECUTABLE IS : mainLanding.py

--→ THERE ARE MODULES FOR EACH USER LOGIN: adminExe.py, studExe.py instExe.py

--→ Classes are in the main folder and are: userClass.py, adminClass.py, studClass.py, instClass.py,

	**see under NOTES section for a file tree with final 
	most file stucture, with legend and labels.

			NOTES
----------------------------------------------------------------

I made all of the ultilities for the admin first. this includes add student, add instuctor, and add courses. These are dynamically called by each module page which is dynamically used by the USER class and it's children. (or that is how it is intended.). I used the User class and it's child classes (admin, student, instructor) to statisfy the object based program as I understood it from the grading criteria. 

I throughly read through the instuctructions and NOT ONCE was there mention that we were not able to use certain modules or import certain fuctions. The professor also did not explicitly state that we couldn't. I used every thing that I currently know how to use or found documentation of usage to my disposale. If this is to change, I will remove this section.

resources used: stackOverflow, W3Schools, LearnPython, GeeksforGeeks, and other help blogs or tutorials for testing and problem solving.

			File Tree
----------------------------------------------------------------
KEY / LEGEND:
★ = the main page, run this first; 
♕ = Parent Class File
♖ = Child Class Files
✽ = admin related files ;
✢ = instructor related files;
✎ = student related files ;
↺ = file for information generated by the other files. PLEASE don't delete. these files will need information before they will populate into the folder. there are data errors to handle the files not being there.
